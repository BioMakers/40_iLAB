**Joanna Brunker***     
CRUK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge

Jo is a postdoctoral research fellow with a PhD in designing devices to measure blood flow, so will contribute her knowledge of device design and biological monitoring.

**Catherine Fitzpatrick**          
Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge

Cat is a postdoctoral research associate currently working with Raspberry Pi programming for medical optics, and with previous experience in medical technology consulting. She will therefore contribute her skills in programming, device development, and assessment of medical market needs.

**Marcel Gehrung**          
CRUK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge

Marcel is a German Masters student studying for six months in Cambridge. He has a background in programming, machine learning, and cell biology, so will help with programming and analysing the biological data.

**Josie Hughes**          
Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge

Josie is a PhD student in robotics, and has extensive experience in teaching electronics and programming to students. She will contribute her expertise on both these fronts to help drive the sessions in schools.

**James Joseph**                
Department of Physics, University of Cambridge

James built optical imaging systems during his PhD, and is characterising imaging system stability for his postdoctoral research. He will therefore contribute to the design and engineering of the monitoring systems and reliability testing.

## Feedback

Nicky Hughes, Computer Science teacher at County Upper School, Bury St. Edmunds:

"A huge thanks to the iLab team for the course on Medical Imaging Technology.  This has been an amazing opportunity for the students and staff to gain hands-on experience of using medical sensing devices.  The trip to CRUK was inspirational and provided a whole new dimension to our understanding of medical technology.  

All the teaching team from Cambridge University have been outstanding and provided our students with excellent STEM role models.  We are particularly pleased that we had a high up take by our female students who really engaged with this use of technology.

The inter disciplinary nature of the course made the course fast paced and exciting to the students.   This had really opened the eyes of the students to the range of possible future careers and courses in STEM subjects.

We cannot thank the iLAB team enough!  Can we arrange another course soon please?"
